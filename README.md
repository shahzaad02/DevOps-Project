# DevOps-Project
The project implementation began by provisioning an Ubuntu virtual machine on Microsoft Azure using Terraform scripts to define the necessary infrastructure components. After the VM was created, Docker was installed to run Jenkins in a containerized environment. Ansible and Terraform were also installed on the VM to handle configuration and provisioning tasks. A structured project directory was set up, containing separate folders for Terraform code, Ansible playbooks, application files, and the Jenkins pipeline script. An SSH key pair was generated to enable secure, passwordless communication between Jenkins and the VM. Jenkins was launched in a Docker container with the required plugins and credentials configured. Finally, a Jenkins pipeline was created to execute Terraform provisioning, Ansible configuration, and static web application deployment in automated stages.
